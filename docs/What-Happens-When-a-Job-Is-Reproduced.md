# What Happens When a Job Is Reproduced

## Requirements to run, build, or reproduce a job
1. The build script generated by Travis-Build, which depends on the Travis-Build version
1. The Dockerfile, which depends on the Travis Docker image used
1. The project repository reset to the commit of the build

## Primary steps of reproducing a job
1. Generate files
    1. Copy and reset the repository
    1. Generate the build script by invoking `travis-build`
    1. Modify the build script generated by `travis-build`
    1. Generate the Dockerfile
1. Build the Docker image and spawn the Docker container
1. Copy the reproduced log and analyze it (compare it with original log)

The code for these steps are located in `reproducer/pipeline/`. Read the source comments in that directory for details that are not described here, including checking for skipping, storing temporary files for reuse, etc.
