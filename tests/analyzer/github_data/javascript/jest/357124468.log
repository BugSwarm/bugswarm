2022-06-23T18:26:11.1645109Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this

2022-06-23T18:35:26.9626838Z     Here's what you can do:
2022-06-23T18:35:26.9627558Z      • If you are trying to use ECMAScript Modules, see [4mhttps://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules[24m for how to enable it.
2022-06-23T18:35:26.9628262Z      • If you are trying to use TypeScript, see [4mhttps://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started#using-typescript[24m
2022-06-23T18:35:26.9629072Z      • To have some of your "node_modules" files transformed, you can specify a custom [1m"transformIgnorePatterns"[22m in your config.
2022-06-23T18:35:26.9629794Z      • If you need a custom transformation specify a [1m"transform"[22m option in your config.
2022-06-23T18:35:26.9630562Z      • If you simply want to mock your non-JS modules (e.g. binary assets) you can stub them out with the [1m"moduleNameMapper"[22m config option.

2022-06-23T18:36:07.0704523Z     Here's what you can do:
2022-06-23T18:36:07.0705192Z      • If you are trying to use ECMAScript Modules, see [4mhttps://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules[24m for how to enable it.
2022-06-23T18:36:07.0706372Z      • If you are trying to use TypeScript, see [4mhttps://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started#using-typescript[24m
2022-06-23T18:36:07.0972795Z      • To have some of your "node_modules" files transformed, you can specify a custom [1m"transformIgnorePatterns"[22m in your config.
2022-06-23T18:36:07.1062761Z      • If you need a custom transformation specify a [1m"transform"[22m option in your config.
2022-06-23T18:36:07.1063635Z      • If you simply want to mock your non-JS modules (e.g. binary assets) you can stub them out with the [1m"moduleNameMapper"[22m config option.
