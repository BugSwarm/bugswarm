2022-06-17T16:00:18.3827977Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2022-06-17T16:00:18.3830266Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2022-06-17T16:00:18.3831962Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2022-06-17T16:00:18.3833138Z 
2022-06-17T16:00:18.3834561Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2022-06-17T16:00:18.3835932Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2022-06-17T16:00:18.3837049Z 
2022-06-17T16:00:18.3837727Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2022-06-17T16:00:18.3838744Z 
2022-06-17T16:00:18.3839262Z Or undo this operation with:
2022-06-17T16:00:18.3840245Z 
2022-06-17T16:00:18.3840717Z   git switch -

2022-06-17T16:04:08.1024757Z   `numpy.distutils` is deprecated since NumPy 1.23.0, as a result
2022-06-17T16:04:08.1025174Z   of the deprecation of `distutils` itself. It will be removed for
2022-06-17T16:04:08.1025587Z   Python >= 3.12. For older Python versions it will remain present.
2022-06-17T16:04:08.1026001Z   It is recommended to use `setuptools < 60.0` for those Python versions.

2022-06-17T16:07:43.3256025Z             can speed up the calculation.  Default is False.

2022-06-17T16:07:43.3257720Z             If True, the values in the returned array are inverted (that is,
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3258272Z             False where an element of `ar1` is in `ar2` and True otherwise).
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3261616Z             Default is False. ``np.in1d(a, b, invert=True)`` is equivalent
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3262932Z             to (but is faster than) ``np.invert(in1d(a, b))``.

2022-06-17T16:07:43.3264027Z             The algorithm to use. This will not affect the final result,
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3269028Z             but will affect the speed. Default will select automatically
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3270349Z             based on memory considerations.
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3270715Z     
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3271386Z             - If 'mergesort', will use a mergesort-based approach. This will have
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3274895Z               a memory usage of roughly 6 times the sum of the sizes of
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3275547Z               `ar1` and `ar2`, not accounting for size of dtypes.
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3276140Z             - If 'dictionary', will use a key-dictionary approach similar
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3276634Z               to a counting sort. This is only available for boolean and
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3277323Z               integer arrays. This will have a memory usage of the
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3277887Z               size of `ar1` plus the max-min value of `ar2`. This tends
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3278354Z               to be the faster method if the following formula is true:
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3278931Z               `log10(len(ar2)) > (log10(max(ar2)-min(ar2)) - 2.27) / 0.927`,
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3279332Z               but may use greater memory.
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3279848Z             - If `None`, will automatically choose 'dictionary' if
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3280317Z               the required memory allocation is less than or equal to
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3280767Z               6 times the sum of the sizes of `ar1` and `ar2`,
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3281293Z               otherwise will use 'mergesort'. This is done to not use
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3281750Z               a large amount of memory by default, even though
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3282271Z                'dictionary' may be faster in most cases.

2022-06-17T16:07:43.3288982Z         `in1d` can be considered as an element-wise function version of the
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3289636Z         python keyword `in`, for 1-D sequences. ``in1d(a, b)`` is roughly
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3290075Z         equivalent to ``np.array([item in b for item in a])``.
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3290620Z         However, this idea fails if `ar2` is a set, or similar (non-sequence)
2022-06-17T16:07:43.3291073Z         container:  As ``ar2`` is converted to an array, in those cases
2022-06-17T16:07:43.4361718Z         ``asarray(ar2)`` is an object array rather than the expected array of
2022-06-17T16:07:43.4362700Z         contained values.

2022-06-17T16:07:43.4497397Z   Python >= 3.12. For older Python versions it will remain present.
2022-06-17T16:07:43.4498108Z   It is recommended to use `setuptools < 60.0` for those Python versions.
