# == Rational ==
# To enable development work in private repo, but at the same time open our work
# in master branch to the public.
#
# == Description ==
# Whenever a push event to master branch happens in this repo, this workflow syncs
# master branches between the current repo and the corresponding public/private
# repo, as defined in `env`.
#
# == Notes ==
# Due to the limitation of expressions in GitHub Actions, we define two `steps`
# with `if` conditions such that only one will be executed during a given `build`,
# depending on whether the current repo is private or public.
#
# The actual sync logic is implemented in this GitHub action:
# https://github.com/BugSwarm/git-mirror-action
#
# The bot account's SSH private key needs to be stored as secrets in both private
# and public repos in order for the `git-mirror-action` workflow to work.
